Pixel-art and Level Designer

While developing a game utilizing unreal engine, I hit writers block due to not designing the levels beforehand on a piece of paper. I began thinking that there should already be a program out there that I can utilize it on my computer instead of on a primative piece of paper. Photoshop and MS Paint weren't working for me, since I did not currently own a working stylus, and I was looking for a program that had a grid-based drawing system. Excel was my next option, but it was far from intuitive when it came to using it as a quick level designer.


So, despite it being way quicker if I just bit the bullet and use graphing paper, I decided to instead to develop the type of software I thought I needed. A sort of "devtool". However, after developing it for a couple days (in Java), I realized that I had instead created a functional pixel-art type graphics editor unintentionally. Anyways, here is the result. v0.01 of LawrLevel, open source and cross platform.
